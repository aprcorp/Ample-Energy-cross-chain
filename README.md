Industry model ::
    Renewable Energy Power Plant Industry Development Research Division
Solar Farm Renewable Power Plant Industry  Ample Energy (AME),  will connect the cryptocurrency market with the renewable energy power plant industry, EV vehicle power station and retail through.  Renewable Energy Trading (Corporate — Community)

Technology and working principle ::
       This class of platform application solutions lays out smart contract terms for renewable energy traders for digital certification. An asset is a transaction between an organization and an organization to a community. Through management through blockchain technology, it builds the credibility of digital asset equity capital. and intermediary exchanges (Ame and Rent Token) using BlockChain cryptographic account reporting, digital asset special ledger. immutable technology for transparency and accountability It also supports real-time reporting. This makes it possible to submit the delivery of electric power to the enterprise and issue a bill of energy trading.
   
      Ample Energy run in platform. The technology on cross  microgrid plug connect to follow up. Real-time energy trading and also is decentralized 
pool-based lending protocol built .Users can earn interest on their digital assets (assets) by supplying supported assets into the protocol. 

      Rest Lending is a decentralized pool-based lending protocol built on on cross chain Ethereum + BSC. Users can earn interest 
on their digital assets (assets) by supplying supported assets into the protocol. We call these users lenders. Assets deposited by lenders 
will be transferred into a smart contract that aggregates total liquidity of each asset into a pooled fund, which is available for borrowers
to borrow. Loans are not matched individually between lenders and borrowers, but are taken from the pooled fund. Interest lenders earn
come from interest that borrowers pay, distributed proportionately to the liquidity they provide.

concept and benefits ::
        Ample Energy run in a blockchain platform (BSC). The technology allows users to interact on the microgrid to follow up. Real-time energy buying, selling and trading This helps create a resilient power industry system that is both resilient and stable. under the concept "Creator of change with technology in the renewable energy industry giving sustainability to every community”
